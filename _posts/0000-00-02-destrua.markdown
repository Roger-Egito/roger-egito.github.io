title: DESTRUA
description: DESTRUA (DESTROY) is the last command remembered by a lonely, self-aware robot trapped in a decaying factory. With nothing but a corrupted directive and a malfunctioning fourth-dimensional loop device, the robot tries - again and again - to destroy its surroundings. Every minute, reality resets. Most actions are undone. But the damage remains. And something is very wrong here.<br><br>Why is the factory falling apart? What caused this endless loop? Can you uncover the truth and finally put an end to the robot’s suffering?<br><br>Originally made for a Game Jam, this was my first attempt at creating a conventional game.<br><br>This game was made using RPG Maker VX ACE.
private: Due to copyrighted content used in the creation of the game, I will not be making the game publicly playable.
