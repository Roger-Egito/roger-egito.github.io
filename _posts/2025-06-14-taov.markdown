title: The Art of Videogames
description: At the end of my English course, I had the opportunity to give a presentation on any topic I wanted. Naturally, I chose games. But rather than using a traditional PowerPoint, I thought “What if I used a game to present the idea of games as art?” — and that’s how The Art of Videogames was born.<br><br>It’s not a conventional game. Instead, it plays more like a walking simulator—an interactive experience with a narrative focus—culminating in a puzzle challenge. It was my way of letting the medium speak for itself.<br><br>This game was made using RPG Maker VX ACE.
private: Due to the various copyrighted content used in the creation of the game, I will not be making the game publicly playable.
