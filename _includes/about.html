          I'm Roger Egito, a developer with a strong focus on building meaningful, high-quality games and digital experiences.
          <br><br>
          I approach every project with deep care and a drive to deliver work that's both functional and thoughtful. I always look to understand the purpose behind the project and deliver something I'm proud to stand behind.

          I like building games that have meaning, fun mechanics, tell stories, and engage people. I consider games to be an art medium that can genuinely help people.
          <br><br>
          Whether I'm designing gameplay mechanics, creating immersive interfaces, writing narratives or developing backend solutions, I enjoy the process and I'm always willing to give it my all.

          When I'm not programming or designing games, I enjoy playing video games, watching anime, GM'ing RPGs and spending time with family and friends.
