## About Me

I'm Roger Egito, a developer with a strong focus on building meaningful, high-quality games and digital experiences.

I approach every project with deep care and a drive to deliver work that's both functional and thoughtful. I always look to understand the purpose behind the project and deliver something I'm proud to stand behind.


I like building games that have meaning, fun mechanics, tell stories, and engage people. I consider games to be an art medium that can genuinely help people.

Whether I'm designing gameplay mechanics, creating immersive interfaces, writing narratives or developing backend solutions, I enjoy the process and I'm always willing to give it my all.


When I'm not programming or designing games, I enjoy playing video games, watching anime, GM'ing RPGs and spending time with family and friends.

If you're looking for a developer who genuinely cares about the product and is ready to bring strong technical skills, creative problem-solving, and a user-centered mindset to your team, let's talk.
